                                Worked on the Ads Monetization team implementing performance metrics that helped to evaluate the
implementation of a new temporal map system in the team’s pipeline. The metrics reflected near real-time
information of the data transferring pipeline while having no impact on the performance of the current system.

to present an alternative to the proprietary tools currently being implemented by the team.

held at ITESM, by providing a Speech interface which users could use to query about the technologies displayed at
the event. It also provided image recognition to detect which item the attendants wanted to know information about.
IBM Watson technologies were used for the conversation module, and Tensorflow for the image recognition server.
